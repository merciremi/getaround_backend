# Level 6

An additional level, for me to scratch my own itches.

1. Discount distribution: make the algorithm constant in terms of time complexity (@see DsicountSchedule).
2. Introduce chainable scopes and where clauses on models
3. Loosen coupling between rentals and options thanks to scopes
4. Check for rental.start_date being after rental.end_date
5. Rescue errors from `File.open` in the controller and adapt the response of the API based on the result.
