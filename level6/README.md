# Level 6

An additional level, for me to scratch my own itches.

Done:

- Discount distribution: make the algorithm constant in terms of time complexity.
- Rescue errors from `File.open` in the controller and adapt the response of the API based on the result.

Doing:

- Allow chaining of where clauses on models.
- Introduce scopes on models.
